abf local build script

usage:
$ abb <command> [<project name>]

supported commands:
clone
build, builda, buildb, buildp... (see below)

<project name> can be omitted for command "build*" if we are in the project dir

conffiles:
first script looking for ~/.abbrc
if it not exists, then looking for .abbrc in curdir


examples:
$ abb clone mandriva-release
this is equivalent to
1. "git clone https://abf.rosalinux.ru/import/mandriva-release.git"
2. "cd mandriva-release"
3. "git checkout -t origin/rosa2012lts"
4. "cd .."
all parts of arguments can be overriden via a conffile
default settings:
proto=https
server=abf.rosalinux.ru
owner=import
remote=origin
branch=rosa2012lts

$ abb build mandriva-release
in this case script tries to determine whether project already cloned
if not - he clones the project
then he tries to build project

you can add suffix to command "build":
builda - like -ba option to rpmbuild
buildb - like -bb option to rpmbuild (by default)
buildp - like -bp option to rpmbuild
and so forth
